[**View My CV**](cv.pdf)

I'm currently completing my Public Health degree at Appalachian State University, where academic work, extracurricular activities, and research have fostered a strong passion for the field. Early in my major, I discovered a particular interest in the statistical applications of public health and quantitative methods. To build a strong foundation for biostatistical work, I pursued a Statistics minor and took foundational mathematics courses to strengthen my understanding of statistical and mathematical concepts. I've really enjoyed combining quantitative and qualitative approaches throughout my studies, and applying these skills to real-world projects has deepened both my understanding of and commitment to using biostatistics to address public health challenges.

My research interests focus on rural health and health behavior, particularly understanding and quantifying how rurality influences personal health choices and using this knowledge to reduce health disparities. I am also interested in applying statistical methods to evaluate innovative technological tools that improve healthcare access in hard-to-reach areas. These interests have been shaped by my coursework and extracurricular experiences.

## Academic & Professional Highlights

**Public Health Departmental Honors Program**  
[Honors Thesis](https://phes.appstate.edu/academic-programs/public-health/public-health-student-resources/departmental-honors-public-health)  

For my Honors thesis, I researched tick-borne illness prevention among long-distance Appalachian Trail hikers. This project involved designing a study from the ground up, including developing a survey, analyzing data, and authoring a formal manuscript. I established a professional partnership with the [Appalachian Trail Conservancy](https://appalachiantrail.org), conducted a learning session on tick-borne illness at their Damascus Trail Center, and contributed a [blog post on tick safety](https://appalachiantrail.org/news-stories/tick-smart-trail-tips/).

**Public Health AmeriCorps Fellowship**  
[Evaluation Team Lead & Lead Fellow](https://phes.appstate.edu/americorps)  

As evaluation team lead, I guided a team evaluating a public health intervention focused on rural mental health and analyzed program data to assess outcomes. Additionally, I authored an abstract based on our evaluation, presented the findings at the [2025 NC Data Summit](https://ncpha.memberclicks.net/nc-public-health-data-summit), and attended the 2025 [NACCHO Prep Summit](https://www.preparednesssummit.org/home).  

In my second fellowship year, I serve as the Lead Fellow, supporting members, coordinating conference opportunities, and acting as a liaison between members and staff.

**MaineHealth Institute for Research**  
[Research Intern](https://mhir.org/)  

During the [Summer Undergraduate Research Program](https://mhir.org/education-training/undergraduate-summer-student-research-program/summer-student-program/), I collaborated with Dr. Kahsi Pedersen on a project characterizing profound autism within specialized inpatient psychiatric facilities. I analyzed 15 years of data, used data visualization techniques, authored a manuscript, and presented findings through a poster and 3-Minute Thesis presentation. I was honored to receive the Paul Gray Research Scholarship.
